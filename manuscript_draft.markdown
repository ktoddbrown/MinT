## Abstract

## Introduction
In recet years, abrupt development of soil biogeochemical models have occured. Abstract models dominated by cohorts of organic carbon (C) pools with inherently different decay rates (e.g. @Parton1988, @Lawrence2011, @ISI:000285769100015, @Friedlingstein2006) have become replaced by microbial explicit models (@Schimel2003, @Wang2013, @Wieder2015a, @Wieder2014, @Wieder2014, @Huang2018). On one hand, several studies showed the superiror performance of microbial explicit models over classical cohort models (@Wieder2013, @Huang2018, @Hararuk2015, @He2014). On the other hand, other studies showed the tendency of these models to unrealistic temporal oscilations due to small perturbations suggesting the (@Sihi2016, @Wang2014, @Li2014).
Microbial explicit models adopt the knowledge of general microbiology to explain coupled organic substrate - microbial dynamic.

## Material and Methods
###Experimental design
Soil microbial culture (see later) was incubated in liquid batch culture microcosms at 24&deg;C in the dark for five days under six different experimental treatments. These treatments included two different organic substrates as a sole source of organic carbon for microbial culture and three different levels of microcosm structural complexity. The treatments were arranged in full factorial design. The two organic substrates were glucose and cellobiose. The three levels of structural complexity of the system were represented by 30 ml serum bottles with liquid medium (denoted as **"BROTH"** further in the text), with liquid medium and mixture of 2.7, 0.1 and 0.1 mm glass beads (5 g of 2.7 mm Biospec glass beads, 2 g of 1.0 mm Biospec glass beads and 1 g of 0.1 mm Next-Advanced glass beads; denoted as **"GLASS"** further in the text) and with liquid medium and glass wool (0.2 g of Pyrex fiber glass wool cutted to ~0.25 cm pieces; denoted as **"WOOL"** further in the text). A total of 12 replicates were prepared for each condition so that four replicates could be harvested at three timepoints; 24, 48, and 120 hr.

###Soil microbial culture
Soil collected from a fertilized prairie plot at the Comparison of Biofuel Systems research site at Iowa State University’s South Reynoldson Farm (Boone County, Iowa) was used to prepare a soil derived microbial inoculum for the microcosm time course experiment. Modified M9 Media was used for soil culturing and was prepared by mixing 300 ml of M9 Minimal Media 10X stock solution (59.623 g anhydrous $NaH_{2}PO_{4}$, 29.938 g $KH_{2}PO_{4}$, 4.967 g NaCl, 10.003 g $NH_{4}Cl$, 1.204 g anhydrous $MgSO_{4}$ and 0.140 g $CaCl_{2}\cdot2H_{2}0$ in 1 l of ultra pure water), 10 ml of Hutner's Trace Element Solution (10 g $C_{6}H_{9}NO_{6}$, 7.3 g KOH, 14.45 g $MgSO_{4}$, 3.335 g $CaCl_{2}\cdot2H_{2}0$, 0.00925 g $(NH_{4})_{6}Mo_{7}O_{24}\cdot4H_{2}0$, 0.099 g $FeSO_{4}\cdot7H_{2}0$ and 50 mL of Hutner's Stock Salt Solution in 1 l of ultra pure water), 1 ml of Biotin (1 g $l^{-1}$), 1 ml of Thiamin (1 g $l^{-1}$) and ultra pure water to 1 l. Twenty replicates were prepared as follows: one gram of air-dried aggregates (>2 mM) were submerged in 10 mL of sterile modified M9 media and 625 uL of sterile Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Lennox; Sigma Aldrich) and incubated at 24&deg;C for 7 days. Following 7 days of incubation, the soil cultures were shaken with ~ten 2.7 mm glass beads (Biospec) for ten seconds.  The soil cultures were pooled in a sterile glass flask, and particles were allowed to settle for 10 minutes. The liquid phase was further transferred to a new sterile flask and capped with aluminum till microcosm inoculation.

###Microcosm
Microcosms were prepared by adding 3 ml of sterilized modified M9 media enriched with 1 $g~l^{-1}$ of organic carbon (cellobiose or glucose) and 1 ml of soil culture inoculum to each of the 72 autoclaved 30 mL serum bottles; 24 empty bottles (BROTH), 24 bottles with a glass wool matrix (WOOL), and 24 bottles with mixed glass bead and glass wool matrix (GLASS). Accounting for the dilution by the inoculum with assumed organic carbon concentration nearly zero, initial organic carbon concentration of the microcosms was 25 $\mu$mol $(C_{S})$ $l^{-1}$. Samples were covered with air permeable Breath Easier (BE) membranes and kept at 24&deg;C in an Innova 42R incubator except when bottle headspace air was sampled for $CO_{2}$ measurements.

###Respiration rate
Microbial respiration rate was measured at the beginning of the experiment and each following day (six times in total). Approximately two hours before the headspace $CO_{2}$ concentration measurement, BE membranes were removed from the incubation vials and replaced by the ruber septa secured with the alluminium cap. Vials headspace was exchanged for the $CO_{2}$-free air and incubated. Headspace was sampled using 5 ml gas tight syringe. 1.5 ml of well mixed headspace air was sampled and directly injected to Li-Cor 7000 (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). $CO_{2}$ concentration was calculated against the calibartion standard gas with the $CO_{2}$ concentration 2000 ppm. $CO_{2}$ concentration was corrected for the $CO_{2}$ dissolution in liquid media according to Sparling and West (@Sparling1990). Respiration rate was calculated as corrected $CO_{2}$ concentration divided by the time between the headspace atmosphere exchange and the measurement.

###Biomass harvest
Immediately after respiration measurement, the whole microcosm culture was transferred to 15 ml conical tubes, and a 2 ml aliquot of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was dispensed into each bottle. Residual biomass was dislodged from bottle and glass matrix with individually wrapped sterile cell scrapers and transferred to corresponding 15 ml conical tubes. An additional 2 ml aliquot of PBS was dispensed into each bottle, and the biomass recovery step was repeated. Recovered biomass was centrifuged at 4,700 g, 4&deg;C for 10 minutes. Cell pellets were suspended in 500 $\mu$l of PBS and transferred to 1.7 ml locking conical tubes. Samples were stored at -80°C.

###Cell lysis, DNA and protein quantification
To lyse cells, 100 $\mu$g of 100 $\mu$m glass beads (Next-Advanced) were dispensed in each tube and lysed by two consecutive five minutes runs in a bead beater (Next-Advanced) staged in a 4&deg;C cold room.  Lysates were centrifuged at 8,000 x g, 4&deg;C for five minutes, and supernatant was transferred to new 1.7 ml conical tubes. DNA from cell lysate was isolated using Qiagen power soil kit following the protocol standard protocol. DNA concentration was measured by Nanodrop meter (**_company_**). A bicinchronic acid assay (Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit) was used as instructed by manufacturer to determine protein concentration. A SpectraMax Plus 384 Microplate Reader was used to measure absorbance at 562 nm following a 30 minute incubation at 37&deg;C. The DNA and protein concentration was converted to C base concentration ($\mu$mol $(C_{DNA})$ $l^{-1}$ or $\mu$mol $(C_{Protein})$ $l^{-1}$) using the conversion factor 0.45 and 0.51 respectively (@Vrede2004).


###Mathematical description
Three different models (Fig. 1) were used to predict the changes in respiration rate ($R_{H}$) and microbial biomass ($C_{MB}$) in time. The Monod model (Fig. 1a) represents the microbial part of the microbial explicit soil biogeochemical model presented by Allison et al. (2010) (@Allison2010; @Wieder2014; @Wieder2013). The MEND model is its adaptation presented by Wang et al. (2013) (@Wang2013). The DB model is an simplified adaptation of Dynamic Energy Budget theory derived by Hanegraaf and Muller (@Hanegraaf2001) for microbial populations. Here we present all models per molar C basis and use the terminology adopted from microbial explicit biogeochemical models for consistency.

####Monod model (Fig. 1a)
In this model, organic substrate ($C_{S}$) is consumed by microbial biomass and converted to $C_{MB}$ or respired. Microbial biomass is dying at constant rate returning used organic carbon to $C_{S}$ pool. Mass balance equations for pools $C_{MB}$ and $C_{S}$ are respectively defined by following equations:

[1] $~~~~~~~~~~\frac{dC_{MB}}{dt}~=~uptake~\times~CUE~-~k_{MB}~\times~C_{MB}$,

[2] $~~~~~~~~~~\frac{dC_{S}}{dt}~=~-uptake~+~k_{MB}~\times~C_{MB}$.


in which CUE is the carbon use efficiency (defined as an amount of $C_{S}$ converted to biomass over the amount of $C_{S}$ taken up) and $k_{MB}$ is the death rate constant of microbial biomass decay process. Microbial carbon uptake is defined by the equation:

[3] $~~~~~~~~~~uptake~=\frac{V_{MAX}~\times~C_{S}~\times~C_{MB}}{K_{M}~+~C_{S}}$,

in which $V_{MAX}$ is maximum velocity constant and $K_{M}$ is affinity constant. Respiration rate is defined as a growth respiration rate ($R_{G}$), which is the constant fraction of uptake:


[4] $~~~~~~~~~~R_{H}~=~R_{G}~=~uptake~\times~(1~-~CUE)$.


####MEND model (Fig. 1b)
In contrast to Monod model, in this model $R_{H}$ consists of two different processes, growth respiration and maintenance respiration ($R_{M}$). $R_{G}$ and $R_{M}$ are respectively defined by following equations:


[5] $~~~~~~~~~~R_{G}~=~(\frac{1}{CUE}~-~1)~\times~\frac{V_{MAX}~\times~C_{S}~\times~C_{MB}}{K_{M}~+~C_{S}}$,

and


[6] $~~~~~~~~~~R_{M}~=~(\frac{1}{CUE}~-~1)~\times~\frac{m_{R}~\times~C_{S}~\times~C_{MB}}{K_{M}~+~C_{S}}$.


In eq. 6, $m_{R}$ is biomass specific maintenance rate constant. Since $R_{G}$ and $R_{M}$ represent a constant fraction of organic C uptake, the equation defining an uptake rate has to take both fluxes into an account and the eq. 3 is rewritten to:


[7] $~~~~~~~~~~uptake~=~\frac{1}{CUE}~\times~(V_{MAX}~+~m_{R}~)\times~\frac{C_{S}~\times~C_{MB}}{K_{M}~+~C_{S}}$.


The overall mass balance equations for pools $C_{MB}$ and $C_{S}$ are respectively:

[8] $~~~~~~~~~~\frac{dC_{MB}}{dt}~=~uptake~-~(R_{G}+R_{M})~-~m_{R}~\times~C_{MB}$,

[9] $~~~~~~~~~~\frac{dC_{S}}{dt}~=~-uptake~+~m_{R}~\times~C_{MB}$.

The last term of eqs. 8 and 9 indicates that the rate of $C_{MB}$ loss due to decay is controled by $m_{R}$.

####DB model (Fig. 1c)
In contrast to previous models, microbial biomass consits of two functional parts, reserves ($R$) and structures ($S$). Whereas $S$ is functionally similar to $C_{MB}$, $R$ represents a "buffering zone" of $C_{MB}$. $C_{S}$ is assimilated into reserves by a rate proportional to $C_{S}$ and $S$:


[10] $~~~~~~~~~~assimilation~=\frac{V_{MAX}~\times~C_{S}~\times~S}{K_{M}~+~C_{S}}$.


Here we assume that the $C_{S}$ is assimilated into R with efficiency equal to one (@Hanegraaf2001). Organic C is released from reserves by a rate proportional to R. The overall mass balance equation for pool R is thus:

[11] $~~~~~~~~~~\frac{dR}{dt}~=~assimilation~-~f_{0}~\times~R$,

where $f_{0}$ is the constant controlling the rate of release of organic C from reserves. The released organic C is used to maintain structures or to grow (i.e. increase pool $S$). However, maintaining structures have a priority over the growth (@Hanegraaf2001). The growth is realized only when reserves contain enough organic C. When pool $R$ doesn't contain enough organic C to maintain $S$, proportional part of $S$ is lost via respiration. The respective mass balance equations for pools $S$ and $C_{S}$ are defined as:

[12] $~~~~~~~~~~\frac{dS}{dt}~=~max\left\{f_{a}~\times~Y_{S},~0\right\}~+~min\left\{f_{a},~0\right\}$,

and

[13] $~~~~~~~~~~\frac{dC_{S}}{dt}~=~-assimilation$.

In eq. 12, $Y_{S}$ is yield or efficiency of structures production (functionaly similar to a $CUE$) and $f_{a}$ is the organic C flux available to construct $S$. Depending on the size of the pool $R$ and the amount of organic C needed to maintain $S$, this flux can be positive or negative. If the flux is positive, $S$ increases, while if it is negative, $S$ is lost via respiration (i.e. to cover required maintenance costs). The flux $f_{a}$ is defined by the equation:

[14] $~~~~~~~~~~f_{a}~=~f_{0}~\times~R~-~m_{R}~\times~S$.

$R_{H}$ consists of two different processes, growth and maintenance respiration:

[15] $~~~~~~~~~~R_{H}~=~R_{G}~+~R_{M}~=~~max\left\{f_{a}~\times~(1-Y_{S}),~0\right\}~+~m_{R}~\times~S$.

###Models evaluation
All three models include parameters, whose value can be adjusted to maximize the correspondence between predictions and observations. Models were calibrated against the measured respiration rate, cellular protein concentration and DNA content. Model parameters were adjusted to minimize the objective function $J$ using the Differential Evolution algorithm (@Mullen2011). The objective function $J$ was defined for each measured variable (i.e. respiration rate, cellular protein concentration and DNA content) as:

[16] $~~~~~~~~~~J~=~\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{(\frac{P_{i}~-~O_{i}}{\mu})^{2}}$,

where $O_{i}$ and $P_{i}$ stand for observation i and its corresponding value predicted by the model, and $\mu$ is the mean of all observations. The objective functions calculated for each measured variable were summed up. Uncertainty of parameters estimates were determined by Constrained Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation on 5000 iterations (@Soetaert2010). To evaluate the goodness of correspondence between models predictions and observations, log likelihood, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and coeficient of determination ($R^{2}$) were calculated. To evaluate the effect of experimental treatments, model parameters and corresponding goodness of fit were calculated across all treatments or for each substrate (glucose and cellobiose), each level of structural complexity (BROTH, GLASS, WOOL) or each experimetal treatment (combination of the substrate and level of structural complexity) separately. The conversion factor between cellular protein concetration or DNA content and $C_{MB}$, $R$ and $S$ was estimated together with model parameters. Monod and Mend model were calibrated against cellular protein concentration and DNA content separately. DB model was calibrated against both measured variables at once (@Hanegraaf2001). Cellular proteins were assumed to be part of $R$ and $S$ and DNA was assumed to be part of $S$ only (@Hanegraaf2001).
When the model parameters are estimated for each experimental treatment separately, the total number of parameters dramatically increases. Therefore, the model parameters with no variability across treatments were kept fixed. All analyses were done in statistical program R (@RDevelopmentCoreTeam2014).
