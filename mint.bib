abstract = {Soil structure and interactions between biotic and abiotic processes are increasingly recognized as important for explaining the large uncertainties in the outputs of macroscopic SOM decomposition models. We present a numerical analysis to assess the role of meso- and macropore topology on the biodegradation of a soluble carbon substrate in variably water saturated and pure diffusion conditions . Our analysis was built as a complete factorial design and used a new 3D pore-scale model, LBioS, that couples a diffusion lattice-Boltzmann model and a compartmental biodegradation model. The scenarios combined contrasted modalities of four factors: meso- and macropore space geometry, water saturation, bacterial distribution and physiology. A global sensitivity analysis of these factors highlighted the role of physical factors in the biodegradation kinetics of our scenarios. Bacteria location explained 28{\%} of the total variance in substrate concentration in all scenarios, while the interactions among location, saturation and geometry explained up to 51{\%} of it.},

Chloroform-labile carbon (CLC) and nitrogen (CLN) determined by chloroform fumigation methods have been the major parameters of soil microbial biomass, but to date, there have been few studies of the relationship between DNA and CLN among soils with different characteristics. We applied DNA assays to the estimation of soil microbial biomass in various types of soil in Japan. The quantitative relationships among DNA, CLC and CLN released by the chloroform fumigation–extraction method were examined in 35 soil samples including five different soil types. The amount of DNA was moderately correlated with CLC (r=0.652, n=35), but there was no significant correlation in one of the soil types (fluvisol) representing a typical soil in Japan (r=0.124; n=15). Moreover, there was a strong correlation between DNA and CLN (r=0.887; n=35), and the correlation was high in every major soil type. These findings raise the possibility that DNA could be used to estimate biomass N even among different kinds of soil, with a conversion factor of 2.75 for DNA ($\mu$gg−1 soil).},

abstract = {Global ecosystem models may require microbial components to accurately predict feedbacks between climate warming and soil decomposition, but it is unclear what parameters and levels of complexity are ideal for scaling up to the globe. Here we conducted a model comparison using a conventional model with first-order decay and three microbial models of increasing complexity that simulate short- to long-term soil carbon dynamics. We focused on soil carbon responses to microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and temperature. Three scenarios were implemented in all models: constant CUE (held at 0.31), varied CUE (-0.016 A degrees C-1), and 50 {\%} acclimated CUE (-0.008 A degrees C-1). Whereas the conventional model always showed soil carbon losses with increasing temperature, the microbial models each predicted a temperature threshold above which warming led to soil carbon gain. The location of this threshold depended on CUE scenario, with higher temperature thresholds under the acclimated and constant scenarios. This result suggests that the temperature sensitivity of CUE and the structure of the soil carbon model together regulate the long-term soil carbon response to warming. Equilibrium soil carbon stocks predicted by the microbial models were much less sensitive to changing inputs compared to the conventional model. Although many soil carbon dynamics were similar across microbial models, the most complex model showed less pronounced oscillations. Thus, adding model complexity (i.e. including enzyme pools) could improve the mechanistic representation of soil carbon dynamics during the transient phase in certain ecosystems. This study suggests that model structure and CUE parameterization should be carefully evaluated when scaling up microbial models to ecosystems and the globe.},

abstract = {A growing body of literature documents the pressing need to develop soil biogeochemistry models that more accurately reflect contemporary understanding of soil processes and better capture soil carbon (C) responses to environmental perturbations. Models that explicitly represent microbial activity offer inroads to improve representations of soil biogeochemical processes, but have yet to consider relationships between litter quality, functional differences in microbial physiology, and the physical protection of microbial byproducts in forming stable soil organic matter (SOM). To address these limitations, we introduce the MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS) model, and evaluate it by comparing site-level soil C projections with observations from a long-term litter decomposition study and soil warming experiment. In MIMICS, the turnover of litter and SOM pools is governed by temperature-sensitive Michaelis–Menten kinetics and the activity of two physiologically distinct microbial functional types. The production of microbial residues through microbial turnover provides inputs to SOM pools that are considered physically or chemically protected. Soil clay content determines the physical protection of SOM in different soil environments. MIMICS adequately simulates the mean rate of leaf litter decomposition observed at temperate and boreal forest sites, and captures observed effects of litter quality on decomposition rates. Moreover, MIMICS better captures the response of SOM pools to experimental warming, with rapid SOM losses but declining temperature sensitivity to long-term warming, compared with a more conventional model structure. MIMICS incorporates current microbial theory to explore the mechanisms by which litter C is converted to stable SOM, and to improve predictions of soil C responses to environmental change.},

Their predictions of soil carbon responses to fresh litter input and warming differ significantly from conventional linear models. Using both stability analysis and numerical simulations, we showed that two of those nonlinear models (a two-pool model and a three-pool model) exhibit damped oscillatory responses to small perturbations.

For both models, the oscillation has a period of between 5 and 15 years depending on other parameter values, and has smaller amplitude at soil temperatures between 0 and 15 °C. In addition, the equilibrium pool sizes of litter or soil carbon are insensitive to carbon inputs in the nonlinear model, but are proportional to carbon input in the conventional linear model. Under warming, the microbial biomass and litter carbon pools simulated by the nonlinear models can increase or decrease, depending whether {\&}varepsilon; varies with temperature. In contrast, the conventional linear models always simulate a decrease in both microbial and litter carbon pools with warming. Based on the evidence available, we concluded that the oscillatory behavior and insensitivity of soil carbon to carbon input are notable features in these nonlinear models that are somewhat unrealistic. We recommend that a better model for capturing the soil carbon dynamics over decadal to centennial timescales would combine the sensitivity of the conventional models to carbon influx with the flexible response to warming of the nonlinear model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The bacteria were enumerated using acridine orange direct counts. An average of 1.40x10(-17) mol bacterial PLFA cell(-1) was found in bacteria extracted from 15 soils covering a wide range of pH and organic matter contents. With this factor, the bacterial biomass based on PLFA analyses of whole soil samples was calculated as 1.0-4.8 mg bacterial C g(-1) soil C. The corresponding range based on microscopical counts was 0.3-3.0 mg bacterial C g(-1) soil C. The recovery of bacteria from the soils using homogenization/centrifugation was 2.6-16{\%} (mean 8.7{\%}) measured by PLFA analysis, and 12-61{\%} (mean 26{\%}) measured as microscopical counts. The soil content of the PLFA 18:2 omega 6 was correlated with the ergosterol content (r=0.92), which supports the use of this PLFA as an indicator of fungal biomass. The ratio 18:2 omega 6 to bacterial PLFA is therefore suggested as an index of the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio in soil. An advantage with the method based on PLFA analyses is that the same technique and even the same sample is used to determine both fungi and bacteria. The fungal:bacterial biomass ratio calculated in this way was positively correlated with the organic matter content of the soils (r=0.94).},

Here, the effects of soil type, particle size, the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) or Fe/Al (hydro)oxides on pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 survival in sterilized soil particles were assessed through survival, attachment, metabolic activity, and qRT-PCR analyses. The abundance of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 in Brown soil (Alfisol) particles increased 0.6–1.4 log10CFU/g within 3{\"{i}}¿½days (except for NOM-stripped clay), while that in Red soil (Ultisol) particles decreased rapidly in 8{\"{i}}¿½days post-inoculation. Additionally, survival of bacteria was significantly enhanced when Fe/Al (hydro)oxides had been removed from Red soil particles. For the two soils, E. coli O157:H7 survived the longest in NOM-present clays and the bacterial adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) levels were 0.7–2.0 times greater in clays than in sands and silts on day 8. Moreover, clays were more effective than silts and sands in binding cells and changing the expressions of acetate pathway-associated genes (pta and ackA). For silts and sands, E. coli O157:H7 decayed more rapidly in the presence of NOM and similar trends of bacterial ATP levels were observed between NOM-stripped and NOM-present soil particles, indicating that the primary role of NOM was not as a nutrient supply. These findings indicate that soil particles function mainly through attachment to change the metabolic pathway of E. coli O157:H7 and ultimately impact the survival of bacterial pathogens in soils.},

abstract = {Neisseria meningitidis is a human pathogen that can infect diverse sites within the human host. The major diseases caused by N. meningitidis are responsible for death and disability, especially in young infants. At the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI) a vaccine against serogroup B organisms is currently being developed. This study describes the influence of the growth rate of N. meningitidis on its macro-molecular composition and its metabolic activity and was determined in chemostat cultures. In the applied range of growth rates, no significant changes in RNA content and protein content with growth rate were observed in N. meningitidis. The DNA content in N. meningitidis was somewhat higher at the highest applied growth rate. The phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide content in N. meningitidis changed with growth rate but no specific trends were observed. The cellular fatty acid composition and the amino acid composition did not change significantly with growth rate. Additionally, it was found that the PorA content in outer membrane vesicles was significantly lower at the highest growth rate. The metabolic fluxes at various growth rates were calculated using flux balance analysis. Errors in fluxes were calculated using Monte Carlo Simulation and the reliability of the calculated flux distribution could be indicated, which has not been reported for this type of analysis. The yield of biomass on substrate (Y(x/s)) and the maintenance coefficient (m(s)) were determined as 0.44 (+/-0.04) g g(-1) and 0.04 (+/-0.02) g g(-1) h(-1), respectively. The growth associated energy requirement (Y(x/ATP)) and the non-growth associated ATP requirement for maintenance (m(ATP)) were estimated as 0.13 (+/-0.04) mol mol(-1) and 0.43 (+/-0.14) mol mol(-1) h(-1), respectively. It was found that the split ratio between the Entner-Doudoroff and the pentose phosphate pathway, the sole glucose utilizing pathways in N. meningitidis, had a minor effect on ATP formation rate but a major effect on the fluxes going through for instance the citric-acid cycle. For this reason, we presented flux ranges for underdetermined parts of metabolic network rather than presenting single flux values, which is more commonly done in literature.},

abstract = {Genome scale metabolic reconstructions are developed to efficiently engineer biocatalysts and bioprocesses based on a rational approach. However, in most reconstructions, due to the lack of appropriate measurements, experimentally determined growth parameters are simply taken from literature including other organisms, which reduces the usefulness and suitability of these models. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is an outstanding biocatalyst given its versatile metabolism, its ability to generate sufficient energy and turnover of NADH and NAD. To apply this strain optimally in industrial production, a previously developed genome-scale metabolic model (iJP815) was experimentally assessed and streamlined to enable accurate predictions of the outcome of metabolic engineering approaches. To substantially improve the accuracy of the genome scale model (iJP815), continuous bioreactor cultures on a mineral medium with glucose as a sole carbon source were carried out at different dilution rates, which covered pulling analysis of the macromolecular composition of the biomass. Besides, the maximum biomass yield (on substrate) of 0.397 gDCW {\textperiodcentered} gglc-1, the maintenance coefficient of 0.037 gglc {\textperiodcentered} gDCW-1 {\textperiodcentered} h-1 and the maximum specific growth rate of 0.59 h-1 were determined. Only the DNA fraction increased with the specific growth rate. This resulted in reliable estimation for the Growth-Associated Maintenance (GAM) of 85 mmolATP {\textperiodcentered} gDCW-1 and the Non Growth-Associated Maintenance (NGAM) of 3.96 mmolATP {\textperiodcentered} gDCW-1 {\textperiodcentered} h-1. Both values were found significantly different from previous assignment as a consequence of a lower yield and higher maintenance coefficient than originally assumed. Contrasting already published 13C flux measurements and the improved model allowed for constraining the solution space, by eliminating futile cycles. Furthermore, the model predictions were compared with transcriptomic data at overall good consistency, which helped to identify missing links. By careful interpretation of growth stoichiometry and kinetics when grown in the presence of glucose, this work reports on an accurate genome scale metabolic model of Pseudomonas putida, providing a solid basis for its use in designing superior strains for biocatalysis. By consideration of substrate specific variation in stoichiometry and kinetics, it can be extended to other substrates and new mutants.},

abstract = {Globally, considerable carbon (C) is stored in soils, particularly in peatlands. These stores play a potentially significant role in atmospheric C-cycle feedbacks, and thus need to be accounted for in global models. However, present global soil models do not accurately represent peat C-stocks and -dynamics; thus, their climate-soil C feedback predictions are questionable. A major shortcoming of current models that are based on the decomposition of soil C pools is the lack of representation of long-term (non-equilibrium) soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, as peat cohorts, with cohort age information. Whereas C-pool models are commonly `spun up' to equilibrium over several hundred years using an average climate, in nature, soils actually evolve over many thousands of years with associated changes in litter amounts and quality, which affect SOC accumulation, and hence peat formation. Secondly, peat soils have a unique hydrology, and changes in the water table depth (WTD) of peat are important in regulating SOC turnover, yet current non-cohort C pool models fail to include such dynamic hydrological processes. We have developed an improved peat age-cohort model called MILLENNIA, with a variable WTD driving C-dynamics during Holocene peat accumulation, allowing validation with peat age data and the testing of a realistic WTD-driven peat SOC stock response to climate-change scenarios. Model C-dynamics showed particular sensitivity to water table dynamics through precipitation and runoff, as well as to litter quality and decomposition rates. We show that predicted SOC accumulation and peat ages compare well with observations from a UK peatland site, which is currently (on average) a weak net C source with strong climate sensitivity.},

abstract = {Whereas it is acknowledged that the C:N:P stoichiometry of consumers and their resources affects both the structure and the function of food webs, and eventually influences broad-scale processes such as global carbon cycles, the mechanistic basis for the variation in stoichiometry has not yet been fully explored. Empirical evidence shows that the specific growth rate is positively related to RNA concentration both between and within taxa in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Since RNA is rich in P and constitutes a substantial part of the, total P in organisms, a high growth rate is also connected with a high P content. We argue that the reason for this pattern is that the growth of all biota is closely linked with their protein synthesis rate, and thus with the concentration of ribosomal RNA. Dynamic energy budget theory supports the positive relationship between RNA and specific growth rate in microorganisms, whereas the predictions concerning multicellulars only partially agrees with the observed pattern. In a simple model of consumer growth, we explore the consequences of various allocation patterns of RNA; protein, carbohydrates/lipids, and other biochemical constituents on organism potential growth rate and C:N:P stoichiometry. According to the model the percentage of N, and especially percentage of P per dry mass increases with increasing specific growth rate. Furthermore, the model suggests that macromolecule allocation patterns and thus N:P stoichiometry are allowed to differ substantially at low growth rates whereas the stoichiometry at high growth rates is much more constricted at low N:R The model fits empirical data reasonably well, but it is also acknowledged that complex life cycles and associated physiological constraints may result in other patterns. We also use a similar approach of modeling organism growth from basic biochemical principles to illustrate fundamental connections among biochemical allocation and C:N stoichiometry in autotroph production, which is based on allocation patterns between carbohydrates and rubisco. Similar to the RNA-protein model, macromolecular composition and C:N ratios are more constrained at high than at low growth rates. The models and the empirical data together suggest that organism growth is tightly linked with the organisms' biochemical and elemental composition. The stoichiometry of growth impinges on nutrient cycles and carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level. Thus, focus on the biological basis of organism C:N:P stoichiometry can mechanistically connect growth strategy and biochemical and cellular mechanisms of biota to major ecological consequences.},

abstract = {Trait-based models are an emerging tool in ecology with the potential to link community dynamics, environmental responses and ecosystem processes. These models represent complex communities by defining taxa with trait combinations derived from prior distributions that may be constrained by trade-offs. Herein I develop a model that links microbial community composition with physiological and enzymatic traits to predict litter decomposition rates. This approach allows for trade-offs among traits that represent alternative microbial strategies for resource acquisition. The model predicts that optimal strategies depend on the level of enzyme production in the whole community, which determines resource availability and decomposition rates. There is also evidence for facilitation and competition among microbial taxa that co-occur on decomposing litter. These interactions vary with community investment in extracellular enzyme production and the magnitude of trade-offs affecting enzyme biochemical traits. The model accounted for 69{\%} of the variation in decomposition rates of 15 Hawaiian litter types and up to 26{\%} of the variation in enzyme activities. By explicitly representing diversity, trait-based models can predict ecosystem processes based on functional trait distributions in a community. The model developed herein illustrates that traits influencing microbial enzyme production are some of the key controls on litter decomposition rates.},

A simple modelling framework was developed to investigate how substrate quality and environmental controls over microbial activity regulate microbial assimilation of soil organic carbon and on the size of the microbial biomass. Substrate quality has a positive effect on microbial assimilation of soil organic carbon: higher substrate quality leads to higher ratio of microbial carbon to soil organic carbon. Microbial biomass carbon peaks and then declines as cumulative activity increases. The simulated ratios of soil microbial biomass to soil organic carbon are reasonably consistent with a recently compiled global data set at the biome level. The modelling framework developed in this study offers a simple approach to incorporate microbial contributions to the carbon cycling into Earth system models to simulate carbon-climate feedbacks and explain global patterns of microbial biomass.},

abstract = {Soils are a key component of the terrestrial carbon cycle as they contain the majority of terrestrial carbon. Soil microorganisms mainly control the accumulation and loss of this carbon. However, traditional concepts of soil carbon stabilisation failed so far to account for environmental and energetic constraints of microorganisms. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that these biological limitations might have the overall control on soil carbon stability. In a long-term experiment, we incubated C-13-labelled compost with natural soils at various soil carbon concentrations. Unexpectedly, we found that soil carbon turnover decreased with lower carbon concentration. We developed a conceptual model that explained these observations. In this model, two types of particles were submitted to random walk movement in the soil profile: soil organic matter substrate and microbial decomposers. Soil carbon turnover depended only on the likelihood of a decomposer particle to meet a substrate particle; in consequence, carbon turnover decreased with lower carbon concentration, like observed in the experiment. This conceptual model was able to simulate realistic depth profiles of soil carbon and soil carbon age. Our results, which are simply based on the application of a two-step kinetic, unmystify the stability of soil carbon and suggest that observations like high carbon ages in subsoil, stability of carbon in fallows and priming of soil carbon might be simply explained by the probability to be decomposed.},

abstract = {Flow-cytometry was used to measure cell volumes and DNA contents of single cells in cultures of soil bacteria during exponential growth and starvation conditions. DNA was measured after staining with mitramycin/ethidium bromide. The measurement of DNA was calibrated with rifampicin-treated cells of E. coli containing even numbers of genomes per cell. Cell volumes were assessed by scatter light measurements. Constant DNA to biovolume relations over a range of cell sizes were found for each of the bacteria at exponential growth, and DNA contents per cell varied over a range equivalent to 1-4 genomes per cell. At generation times of 1.0-1.5 h, two genomes were registered as a mean. After starvation of washed cells in a salt solution (24 hrs), a fraction of the cells in each culture had DNA contents equivalent to 1 genome, but significant fractions retained DNA contents equivalent to 2-4 genomes. Attempts to create cells with even numbers of genomes per cell by treatment with rifampicin was successful on an Acinetobacter sp. In contrast, the response to rifampicin was less clear for Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. chlororaphis, and unclear for the gram positive bacteria isolated from soil. The mean decrease in biovolume upon starvation was 4.1 times (range 1.3-8.1 times) and larger than the mean decrease in DNA content of 1.8 (range 1.3-2.7 times). Cell volume determinations by measurements of scatter light was compared with volume determinations by fluorescence microscopy. The amounts of scatter light per volumes was variable, not only did we find large differences between bacterial types, but also between starving and exponentially growing cells of the same isolate. In order to use light scatter as a measure of biovolume, internal standards has to be chosen of comparable size and surface properties as to soil bacteria. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Bacteria produce extracellular enzymes to obtain resources from complex chemical substrates, but this strategy is vulnerable to cheating by cells that take up reaction products without paying the cost of enzyme production. We hypothesized that cheating would suppress enzyme production in co-cultures of cheater and producer bacteria, particularly under well-mixed conditions. To test this hypothesis, we monitored protease expression and frequencies of Pseudomonas fluorescens producer and cheater genotypes over time in mixed liquid cultures and on agar plates. In mixed culture inoculated with equal frequencies of cheaters and producers, enzyme concentration declined to zero after 20 days, consistent with our hypothesis. We observed a similar decline in cultures inoculated with producers only, suggesting that cheater mutants arose de novo and swept the population. DNA sequencing showed that genetic changes most likely occurred outside the protease operon. In one experimental replicate, the population regained the ability to produce protease, likely due to further genetic changes or population dynamics. Under spatially structured conditions on agar plates, cheaters did not sweep the population. Instead, we observed a significant increase in the variation of enzyme activity levels expressed by clones isolated from the population. Together these results suggest that restricted diffusion favors a diversity of enzyme production strategies. In contrast, well-mixed conditions favor population sweeps by cheater strains, consistent with theoretical predictions. Cheater and producer strategies likely coexist in natural environments with the frequency of cheating increasing with diffusion rate.},

abstract = {Permafrost-affected soils in the Northern latitudes store huge amounts of organic carbon (OC) that is prone to microbial degradation and subsequent release of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. In Greenland, the consequences of permafrost thaw have only recently been addressed, and predictions on its impact on the carbon budget are thus still highly uncertain. However, the fate of OC is not only determined by abiotic factors, but closely tied to microbial activity. We investigated eight soil profiles in northeast Greenland comprising two sites with typical tundra vegetation and one wet fen site. We assessed microbial community structure and diversity (SSU rRNA gene tag sequencing, quantification of bacteria, archaea and fungi), and measured hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities. Sampling site and thus abiotic factors had a significant impact on microbial community structure, diversity and activity, the wet fen site exhibiting higher potential enzyme activities and presumably being a hot spot for anaerobic degradation processes such as fermentation and methanogenesis. Lowest fungal to bacterial ratios were found in topsoils that had been relocated by cryoturbation ("buried topsoils"), resulting from a decrease in fungal abundance compared to recent ("unburied") topsoils. Actinobacteria (in particular Intrasporangiaceae) accounted for a major fraction of the microbial community in buried topsoils, but were only of minor abundance in all other soil horizons. It was indicated that the distribution pattern of Actinobacteria and a variety of other bacterial classes was related to the activity of phenol oxidases and peroxidases supporting the hypothesis that bacteria might resume the role of fungi in oxidative enzyme production and degradation of phenolic and other complex substrates in these soils. Our study sheds light on the highly diverse, but poorly-studied communities in permafrost-affected soils in Greenland and their role in OC degradation.},

abstract = {The role of soil microorganisms in regulating soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is of primary importance in the carbon cycle, in particular in the context of global change. Modeling soil microbial community dynamics to simulate its impact on soil gaseous carbon (C) emissions and nitrogen (N) mineralization at large spatial scales is a recent research field with the potential to improve predictions of SOM responses to global climate change. In this study we present a SOM model called ORCHIMIC, which utilizes input data that are consistent with those of global vegetation models. ORCHIMIC simulates the decomposition of SOM by explicitly accounting for enzyme production and distinguishing three different microbial functional groups: fresh organic matter (FOM) specialists, SOM specialists, and generalists, while also implicitly accounting for microbes that do not produce extracellular enzymes, i.e., cheaters. ORCHIMIC and two other organic matter decomposition models, CENTURY (based on first-order kinetics and representative of the structure of most current global soil carbon models) and PRIM (with FOM accelerating the decomposition rate of SOM), were calibrated to reproduce the observed respiration fluxes of FOM and SOM from the incubation experiments of Blagodatskaya et al. (2014). Among the three models, ORCHIMIC was the only one that effectively captured both the temporal dynamics of the respiratory fluxes and the magnitude of the priming effect observed during the incubation experiment. ORCHIMIC also effectively reproduced the temporal dynamics of microbial biomass. We then applied different idealized changes to the model input data, i.e., a 5 K stepwise increase of temperature and/or a doubling of plant litter inputs. Under 5 K warming conditions, ORCHIMIC predicted a 0.002 K−1 decrease in the C use efficiency (defined as the ratio of C allocated to microbial growth to the sum of C allocated to growth and respiration) and a 3 {\%} loss of SOC. Under the double litter input scenario, ORCHIMIC predicted a doubling of microbial biomass, while SOC stock increased by less than 1 {\%} due to the priming effect. This limited increase in SOC stock contrasted with the proportional increase in SOC stock as modeled by the conventional SOC decomposition model (CENTURY), which can not reproduce the priming effect. If temperature increased by 5 K and litter input was doubled, ORCHIMIC predicted almost the same loss of SOC as when only temperature was increased. These tests suggest that the responses of SOC stock to warming and increasing input may differ considerably from those simulated by conventional SOC decomposition models when microbial dynamics are included. The next step is to incorporate the ORCHIMIC model into a global vegetation model to perform simulations for representative sites and future scenarios.},

abstract = {Abstract. Projecting biogeochemical responses to global environmental change requires multi-scaled perspectives that consider organismal diversity, ecosystem processes, and global fluxes. However, microbes, the drivers of soil organic matter decomposition and stabilization, remain notably absent from models used to project carbon (C) cycle–climate feedbacks. We used a microbial trait-based soil C model with two physiologically distinct microbial communities, and evaluate how this model represents soil C storage and response to perturbations. Drawing from the application of functional traits used to model other ecosystems, we incorporate copiotrophic and oligotrophic microbial functional groups in the MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS) model; these functional groups are akin to "gleaner" vs. "opportunist" plankton in the ocean, or r- vs. K-strategists in plant and animal communities. Here we compare MIMICS to a conventional soil C model, DAYCENT (the daily time-step version of the CENTURY model), in cross-site comparisons of nitrogen (N) enrichment effects on soil C dynamics. MIMICS more accurately simulates C responses to N enrichment; moreover, it raises important hypotheses involving the roles of substrate availability, community-level enzyme induction, and microbial physiological responses in explaining various soil biogeochemical responses to N enrichment. In global-scale analyses, we show that MIMICS projects much slower rates of soil C accumulation than a conventional soil biogeochemistry in response to increasing C inputs with elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) – a finding that would reduce the size of the land C sink estimated by the Earth system. Our findings illustrate that tradeoffs between theory and utility can be overcome to develop soil biogeochemistry models that evaluate and advance our theoretical understanding of microbial dynamics and soil biogeochemical responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {Microbes influence soil organic matter decomposition and the long-term stabilization of carbon (C) in soils. We contend that by revising the representation of microbial processes and their interactions with the physicochemical soil environment, Earth system models (ESMs) will make more realistic global C cycle projections. Explicit representation of microbial processes presents considerable challenges due to the scale at which these processes occur. Thus, applying microbial theory in ESMs requires a framework to link micro-scale process-level understanding and measurements to macro-scale models used to make decadal- to century-long projections. Here we review the diversity, advantages, and pitfalls of simulating soil biogeochemical cycles using microbial-explicit modeling approaches. We present a roadmap for how to begin building, applying, and evaluating reliable microbial-explicit model formulations that can be applied in ESMs. Drawing from experience with traditional decomposition models, we suggest the following: (1) guidelines for common model parameters and output that can facilitate future model intercomparisons; (2) development of benchmarking and model-data integration frameworks that can be used to effectively guide, inform, and evaluate model parameterizations with data from well-curated repositories; and (3) the application of scaling methods to integrate microbial-explicit soil biogeochemistry modules within ESMs. With contributions across scientific disciplines, we feel this roadmap can advance our fundamental understanding of soil biogeochemical dynamics and more realistically project likely soil C response to environmental change at global scales.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown that the broad empirical relationships used in many ecosystem models to predict carbon turnover and stabilization in soils can fail to capture differences across vegetation types or climates. Theoretically, because energy flow is fundamental to the function of decomposer organisms and ecosystems, energetics could provide complimentary fundamental constraints on soil C dynamics. Often, however, C is considered as a surrogate for energy in studies of detrital decay and C turnover in soil. Bomb calorimetry has long been used to measure stored energy in organic matter, but in detritus not all of the energy is bioavailable. Here I outline an approach to quantify the flux of bioavailable energy dissipated by resident heterotrophic communities in soil organic horizons in situ. I used the principle of energy balance together with a biogeochemical process model parameterized through calorimetric analysis of field samples. I also tested relationships between C and energy across samples of forest detritus (foliar and fine root litter, well-decayed Oea material, and woody debris), across decay stages, and between a deciduous and coniferous forest at the Harvard Forest, MA, USA. As a first approximation, energy and C concentrations were closely related (within ca. 10{\%}), as were ratios of heterotrophic energy dissipation to C mineralization across types of detritus (within 16{\%}). Differences in energy content and energy: C ratios were measurable in forest detritus (particularly woody vs nonwoody), but did not vary reliably enough between forest types or through detrital stages to indicate that soil C models could be improved by including energetics. Model results indicated that there are strong similarities in energy flows and storage in the O horizons of the contrasting forest types studied at this location. Future research could focus on broader patterns across climates or biomes.},

abstract = {High-latitude ecosystems store approximately 1700Pg of soil carbon (C), which is twice as much C as is currently contained in the atmosphere. Permafrost thaw and subsequent microbial decomposition of permafrost organic matter could add large amounts of C to the atmosphere, thereby influencing the global C cycle. The rates at which C is being released from the permafrost zone at different soil depths and across different physiographic regions are poorly understood but crucial in understanding future changes in permafrost C storage with climate change. We assessed the inherent decomposability of C from the permafrost zone by assembling a database of long-term ({\textgreater}1year) aerobic soil incubations from 121 individual samples from 23 high-latitude ecosystems located across the northern circumpolar permafrost zone. Using a three-pool (i.e., fast, slow and passive) decomposition model, we estimated pool sizes for C fractions with different turnover times and their inherent decomposition rates using a reference temperature of 5 degrees C. Fast cycling C accounted for less than 5{\%} of all C in both organic and mineral soils whereas the pool size of slow cycling C increased with C:N. Turnover time at 5 degrees C of fast cycling C typically was below 1year, between 5 and 15years for slow turning over C, and more than 500years for passive C. We project that between 20 and 90{\%} of the organic C could potentially be mineralized to CO2 within 50 incubation years at a constant temperature of 5 degrees C, with vulnerability to loss increasing in soils with higher C:N. These results demonstrate the variation in the vulnerability of C stored in permafrost soils based on inherent differences in organic matter decomposability, and point toward C:N as an index of decomposability that has the potential to be used to scale permafrost C loss across landscapes.},

abstract = {Long-term carbon (C) cycle feedbacks to climate depend on the future dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC). Current models show low predictive accuracy at simulating contemporary SOC pools, which can be improved through parameter estimation. However, major uncertainty remains in global soil responses to climate change, particularly uncertainty in how the activity of soil microbial communities will respond. To date, the role of microbes in SOC dynamics has been implicitly described by decay rate constants in most conventional global carbon cycle models. Explicitly including microbial biomass dynamics into C cycle model formulations has shown potential to improve model predictive performance when assessed against global SOC databases. This study aimed to data-constrained parameters of two soil microbial models, evaluate the improvements in performance of those calibrated models in predicting contemporary carbon stocks, and compare the SOC responses to climate change and their uncertainties between microbial and conventional models. Microbial models with calibrated parameters explained 51{\%} of variability in the observed total SOC, whereas a calibrated conventional model explained 41{\%}. The microbial models, when forced with climate and soil carbon input predictions from the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), produced stronger soil C responses to 95 years of climate change than any of the 11 CMIP5 models. The calibrated microbial models predicted between 8{\%} (2-pool model) and 11{\%} (4-pool model) soil C losses compared with CMIP5 model projections which ranged from a 7{\%} loss to a 22.6{\%} gain. Lastly, we observed unrealistic oscillatory SOC dynamics in the 2-pool microbial model. The 4-pool model also produced oscillations, but they were less prominent and could be avoided, depending on the parameter values.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition to global environmental change is a topic of prominent relevance for the global carbon cycle. Decomposition depends on multiple factors that are being altered simultaneously as a result of global environmental change; therefore, it is important to study the sensitivity of the rates of soil organic matter decomposition with respect to multiple and interacting drivers. In this manuscript, we present an analysis of the potential response of decomposition rates to simul-taneous changes in temperature and moisture. To address this problem, we first present a theoretical frame-work to study the sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition when multiple driving factors change simultaneously. We then apply this framework to models and data at different levels of abstraction: (1) to a mechanistic model that addresses the limitation of enzyme activity by simultaneous effects of temperature and soil water content, the latter controlling substrate supply and oxygen concentration for microbial activ-ity; (2) to different mathematical functions used to represent temperature and moisture effects on decom-position in biogeochemical models. To contrast model predictions at these two levels of organization, we compiled different data sets of observed responses in field and laboratory studies. Then we applied our con-ceptual framework to: (3) observations of heterotrophic respiration at the ecosystem level; (4) laboratory experiments looking at the response of heterotrophic respiration to independent changes in moisture and temperature; and (5) ecosystem-level experiments manipulating soil temperature and water content simultaneously.},

Carbohydrates present in the cell wall, i.e., glucans and chitin, and carbohydrates serving as storage materials, i.e., glycogen, were measured, It was observed that the levels of DNA and lipids are relative constant, whereas the proteins and stable RNA levels increase with the specific growth rate and the total amount of carbohydrates decreases with the specific growth rate. Glycogen is only present in small amounts, decreasing with the specific growth rate. As an average the measured macromolecules account for 77 +/- 2{\%} (w/w) of the biomass, On the basis of estimations of the metabolic costs for biosynthesis and polymerization of the different macromolecules the total ATP and NADPH requirements for cell biosynthesis from glucose and inorganic salts, i.e., Y-xATP,Y-growth, and Y-xNADPH, have been quantified, The biosynthesis of 1 g biomass was calculated to require 39.9 mmol of ATP and 7.5 mmol of NADPH when cytosolic acetyl-CoA is formed from citrate by citrate lyase and oxaloacetate is recycled back into the TCA cycle. Other pathways of acetyl-CoA biosynthesis have been considered, The calculations show that the different biosynthetic routes for generating cytosolic. acetyl-CoA have a significant influence on the theoretical value of ATP and NADPH requirements for cell biosynthesis, Combining a detailed stoichiometric model for growth and product formation of P. chrysogenum with experimental data on the macromolecular composition of P. chrysogenum and precise measurements of substrate uptake and product formation the intracellular flux distribution was calculated for different cultivation conditions.},

For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The high...},

abstract = {Conventional Q10 soil organic matter decomposition models and more complex microbial models are available for making projections of future soil carbon dynamics. However, it is unclear (1) how well the conceptually different approaches can simulate observed decomposition and (2) to what extent the trajectories of long-term simulations differ when using the different approaches. In this study, we compared three structurally different soil carbon (C) decomposition models (one Q10 and two microbial models of different complexity), each with a one- and two-horizon version. The models were calibrated and validated using 4 years of measurements of heterotrophic soil CO2 efflux from trenched plots in a Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) plantation. All models reproduced the observed heterotrophic component of soil CO2 efflux, but the trajectories of soil carbon dynamics differed substantially in 100 year simulations with and without warming and increased litterfall input, with microbial models that produced better agreement with observed changes in soil organic C in long-term warming experiments. Our results also suggest that both constant and varying carbon use efficiency are plausible when modeling future decomposition dynamics and that the use of a short-term (e.g., a few years) period of measurement is insufficient to adequately constrain model parameters that represent long-term responses of microbial thermal adaption. These results highlight the need to reframe the representation of decomposition models and to constrain parameters with long-term observations and multiple data streams. We urge caution in interpreting future soil carbon responses derived from existing decomposition models because both conceptual and parameter uncertainties are substantial.},

Concurrently, substrate addition increased the respiratory quotient (RQ), defined as the ratio of mol CO2 evolution per mol O-2 uptake. Anabolic processes were mainly induced by glucose addition. Soil preconditioned with glucose showed a decrease in the RQ value during glucose-induced microbial growth in comparison to non-amended control. The decrease in the RQ value induced by preconditioning with cellulose and humic acid was lower. Glucose, cellulose, and humic acid addition modified the microbial biomass as estimated by fumigation-extraction (FE), substrate-induced respiration (SIR), and ATP content. Since each biomass estimate refers to specific microbial components, shifts in microbial eco-physiology and community structure induced by substrate quality were reflected by SIR : FE and SIR : ATP ratios.

abstract = {We review recent experimental results on the role of soil biota in stabilizing or destabilizing soil organic matter (SOM). Specifically, we analyze how the differential substrate utilization of the various decomposer organisms contributes to a decorrelation of chemical stability, residence time, and carbon (C) age of organic substrates.. Along soil depth profiles, a mismatch of C allocation and abundance of decomposer organisms is consistently observed, revealing that a relevant proportion of soil C is not subjected to efficient decomposition. Results from recent field and laboratory experiments suggest that (1) bacterial utilization of labile carbon compounds is limited by short-distance transport processes and, therefore, can take place deep in the soil under conditions of effective local diffusion or convection . In contrast, (2) fungal utilization of phenolic substrates, including lignin, appears to be restricted to the upper soil layer due to the requirement for oxygen of the enzymatic reaction involved. (3) Carbon of any age is utilized by soil microorganisms, and microbial C is recycled in the microbial food web. Due to stoichiometric requirements of their metabolism, (4) soil animals tend to reduce the C concentration of SOM disproportionally, until it reaches a threshold level. The reviewed investigations provide new and quantitative evidence that different soil C pools underlie divergent biological constraints of decomposition. The specialization of decomposers towards different substrates and microhabitats leads to a relatively longer persistence of virtually all kinds of organic substrates in the nonpreferred soil spaces. We therefore propose to direct future research explicitly towards such biologically nonpreferred areas where decomposition rates are slow, or where decomposition is frequently interrupted, in order to assess the potential for long-term preservation of C in the soil.},

abstract = {The biomass composition of microorganisms depends on the growth conditions. This study explores whether a two-component model can explain how the elemental and macromolecular composition of the biomass of bacteria varies with the specific growth rate. The model describes the rates at which microorganisms assimilate substrates into reserves and utilize reserves for maintenance and growth. Crucial model assumptions are that biomass consists of reserves and structure and that each of these components has an invariant composition. The composition of biomass can vary when the ratio between reserves and structure varies. Literature data on the macromolecular composition of Escherichia coli, cultivated on various substrates, show that the protein, RNA and DNA content of biomass follow a distinctive trend when plotted as a function of the dry-weight-specific growth rate. This observation leads to the proposition that the macromolecular composition of E. coli depends directly on the growth rate, and only indirectly on the carbon- and energy-source used as substrate. We show that the variation of the macromolecular composition of E. coli over its entire range of growth rates can be described with invariant macromolecular compositions of the reserve and structural components of biomass. The model is also applied to our data on a succinate-limited continuous culture of Paracoccus denitrificans. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Indigenous soil bacteria were released from a clay loam soil by repeated washing and centrifugation followed by density gradient centrifugation to remove enough soil particles to allow a flow cytometric (FC) study of cell numbers, cell sizes, and DNA content in single cells. The bacteria were suspended in liquid soil extract medium and incubated at 15°C for 60 h, during which direct fluorescence microscopic counts (acridine orange direct counts, AODC) were done along with the FC measurements. Cells of Escherichia coli with a known number of whole genomes per cell (rifampicin treated) were used as a calibration standard both for the DNA measurements (mitramycin-ethidium bromide stain) and cell volumes (light scatter). In response to the nutrients in the soil extract medium, the indigenous soil bacteria increased in numbers and respiration rate after a lag period of about 17 h. The onset of growth was seen first as an increase in respiration rate, numbers of large cells, and the amounts of DNA per cell in the large cells. Respiration and direct microscopical determination of biovolume was used to calculate the average growth yield on the basis of cell carbon, which was found to be 20-30{\%} during the period of active growth. For separate volume groups of the indigenous cells, the DNA content ranged from 1.5 to 15 fg DNA per cell, the majority being below 4 fg DNA. During growth in soil extract medium, the numbers of large cells (volume {\textgreater} 0.18 $\mu$m3) increased, and the frequency of cells with high DNA contents increased as well for this group. For the smallest sized cells (volumes {\textless} 0.065 $\mu$m3) it was not possible to detect any increase in numbers during the 60-h incubation, and the DNA contents of these cells remained virtually unchanged. Compared with cell volumes based on microscopy (AODC), the FC-light scatter data grossly overestimated the volume for indigenous cells but apparently not for the newly formed cells during growth in the suspension. This probably reflects differences in light scatter properties due to adsorbed materials on the indigenous cells. The FC-DNA measurements confirmed earlier findings in that the average DNA content per cell was low (around 2 fg DNA per cell), but demonstrated a positive relationship between cell size and DNA content for indigenous cells. {\textcopyright} 1995 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {Rising temperatures are expected to reduce global soil carbon (C) stocks, driving a positive feedback to climate change(1-3). However, the mechanisms underlying this prediction are not well understood, including how temperature affects microbial enzyme kinetics, growth efficiency (MGE), and turnover(4,5). Here, in a laboratory study, we show that microbial turnover accelerates with warming and, along with enzyme kinetics, determines the response of microbial respiration to temperature change. In contrast, MGE, which is generally thought to decline with warming(6-8), showed no temperature sensitivity. A microbial-enzyme model suggests that such temperature sensitive microbial turnover would promote soil C accumulation with warming, in contrast to reduced soil C predicted by traditional biogeochemical models. Furthermore, the effect of increased microbial turnover differs from the effects of reduced MGE, causing larger increases in soil C stocks. Our results demonstrate that the response of soil C to warming is affected by changes in microbial turnover. This control should be included in the next generation of models to improve prediction of soil C feedbacks to warming.},

abstract = {The chemical structure of organic matter has been shown to be only marginally important for its decomposability by microorganisms. The question of why organic matter does accumulate in the face of powerful microbial degraders is thus key for understanding terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycling. Here we demonstrate, based on an individual-based microbial community model, that social dynamics among microbes producing extracellular enzymes ('decomposers') and microbes exploiting the catalytic activities of others ('cheaters') regulate organic matter turnover. We show that the presence of cheaters increases nitrogen retention and organic matter build-up by downregulating the ratio of extracellular enzymes to total microbial biomass, allowing nitrogen-rich microbial necromass to accumulate. Moreover, increasing catalytic efficiencies of enzymes are outbalanced by a strong negative feedback on enzyme producers, leading to less enzymes being produced at the community level. Our results thus reveal a possible control mechanism that may buffer soil CO2 emissions in a future climate.},

abstract = {Most ecosystem models predict that climate warming will stimulate microbial decomposition of soil carbon, producing a positive feedback to rising global temperatures(1,2). Although field experiments document an initial increase in the loss of CO(2) from soils in response to warming, in line with these predictions, the carbon dioxide loss from soils tends to decline to control levels within a few years(3-5). This attenuation response could result from changes in microbial physiological properties with increasing temperature, such as a decline in the fraction of assimilated carbon that is allocated to growth, termed carbon-use efficiency(6). Here we explore these mechanisms using a microbial-enzyme model to simulate the responses of soil carbon to warming by 5 degrees C. We find that declines in microbial biomass and degradative enzymes can explain the observed attenuation of soil-carbon emissions in response to warming. Specifically, reduced carbon-use efficiency limits the biomass of microbial decomposers and mitigates the loss of soil carbon. However, microbial adaptation or a change in microbial communities could lead to an upward adjustment of the efficiency of carbon use, counteracting the decline in microbial biomass and accelerating soil-carbon loss. We conclude that the soil-carbon response to climate warming depends on the efficiency of soil microbes in using carbon.},

abstract = {Enzyme-mediated decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is controlled, amongst other factors, by organic matter properties and by the microbial decomposer community present. Since microbial community composition and SOM properties are often interrelated and both change with soil depth, the drivers of enzymatic decomposition are hard to dissect. We investigated soils from three regions in the Siberian Arctic, where carbon rich topsoil material has been incorporated into the subsoil (cryoturbation). We took advantage of this subduction to test if SOM properties shape microbial community composition, and to identify controls of both on enzyme activities. We found that microbial community composition (estimated by phospholipid fatty acid analysis), was similar in cryoturbated material and in surrounding subsoil, although carbon and nitrogen contents were similar in cryoturbated material and topsoils. This suggests that the microbial community in cryoturbated material was not well adapted to SOM properties. We also measured three potential enzyme activities (cellobiohydrolase, leucine-amino-peptidase and phenoloxidase) and used structural equation models (SEMs) to identify direct and indirect drivers of the three enzyme activities. The models included microbial community composition, carbon and nitrogen contents, clay content, water content, and pH. Models for regular horizons, excluding cryoturbated material, showed that all enzyme activities were mainly controlled by carbon or nitrogen. Microbial community composition had no effect. In contrast, models for cryoturbated material showed that enzyme activities were also related to microbial community composition. The additional control of microbial community composition could have restrained enzyme activities and furthermore decomposition in general. The functional decoupling of SOM properties and microbial community composition might thus be one of the reasons for low decomposition rates and the persistence of 400 Gt carbon stored in cryoturbated material.},

abstract = {Computational representations of metabolism are increasingly common in medical, environmental, and bioprocess applications. Cellular growth is often an important output of computational biology analyses, and therefore, accurate measurement of biomass constituents is critical for relevant model predictions. There is a distinct lack of detailed macromolecular measurement protocols, including comparisons to alternative assays and methodologies, as well as tools to convert the experimental data into biochemical reactions for computational biology applications. Herein is compiled a concise literature review regarding methods for five major cellular macromolecules (carbohydrate, DNA, lipid, protein, and RNA) with a step-by-step protocol for a select method provided for each macromolecule. Additionally, each method was tested on three different bacterial species, and recommendations for troubleshooting and testing new species are given. The macromolecular composition measurements were used to construct biomass synthesis reactions with appropriate quality control metrics such as elemental balancing for common computational biology methods, including flux balance analysis and elementary flux mode analysis. Finally, it was demonstrated that biomass composition can substantially affect fundamental model predictions. The effects of biomass composition on in silico predictions were quantified here for biomass yield on electron donor, biomass yield on electron acceptor, biomass yield on nitrogen, and biomass degree of reduction, as well as the calculation of growth associated maintenance energy; these parameters varied up to 7{\%}, 70{\%}, 35{\%}, 12{\%}, and 40{\%}, respectively, between the reference biomass composition and ten test biomass compositions. The current work furthers the computational biology community by reviewing literature regarding a variety of common analytical measurements, developing detailed procedures, testing the methods in the laboratory, and applying the results to metabolic models, all in one publicly available resource.},

abstract = {An underlying assumption of most soil carbon (C) dynamics models is that soil microbial communities are functionally similar; in other words, that microbial activity under given conditions is not dependent on the composition or diversity of the communities. Although a number of studies have indicated that microbial communities are not intrinsically functionally similar, most soil C dynamics models can adequately describe C dynamics without explicitly describing microbial functioning. Here, we provide a mechanistic basis for reconciling this apparent discrepancy. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, we show that the environmental context (soil and pore-network properties) of microbial communities can constrain the activity of functionally different communities to such an extent that their activities are indistinguishable. The data also suggest that when microbial activity is less constrained, the intrinsic functional differences among communities can be expressed. We conclude that soil C dynamics may depend on microbial community structure or diversity in environments where their activity is less constrained, such as the rhizosphere or the litter layer, but not in oligotrophic environments such as the mineral layers of soil.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon is chemically heterogeneous, and microbial decomposers face a physiological challenge in metabolizing the diverse array of compounds present in soil. Different classes of polymeric compounds may require specialized enzymatic pathways for degradation, each of which requires an investment of microbial resources. Here we tested the resource allocation hypothesis, which posits that decomposition rates should increase once substrate concentrations are sufficient to overcome biochemical investment costs. We also tested the alternative hypothesis that mixing different substrates increases resource acquisition through priming effects involving generalist enzymes. Using a microcosm approach, we varied the soil concentration of seven distinct substrates individually and in mixture. We found that the percent carbon respired from starch, cellulose, chitin, and the mixture was significantly reduced at the lowest substrate concentration. The activities of beta-glucosidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase that target cellulose and chitin, respectively, were also significantly lower at the lowest concentrations of their target substrates. However, we did not observe parallel declines in enzyme activity with starch or the mixture. Some enzymes, such as beta-xylosidase, were consistent with specialist strategies because they showed the highest activity in the presence of their target substrate. Other enzymes were more generalist, with activity observed across multiple substrates. Together, these results suggest that the costs of biochemical machinery limit microbial decomposition of substrates at low concentration. The presence of enzymes with low substrate specificity was not sufficient to overcome this constraint for some substrates. Concentration constraints driven by microbial allocation patterns may be common in mineral soil and could be represented in new biogeochemical models based on microbial physiology.

abstract = {The fumigation-extraction method to estimate microbial C was applied to a range of seven soils with organic-C contents up to 47{\%}. The additional oxidizable organic-C released by chcl3fumigation at -5 kPa water potential followed by extraction with 0.5 m K2SO4. was compared with the microbial C estimated by a modified substrate-induced-respiration (SIR) method, and by in situ labelling of cells with [14C]glucose. The extractable organic-C flush comprised 37-63{\%} of the microbial C. The overall kecfactors, to convert from the organic-C flush to microbial C were 0.37 for the SIR method and 0.42 by14C-labelling. The relationship between microbial C and the oxidizable C released by fumigation was similar for both organic and mineral soils. Accumulated data from 168 comparisons of the relationship between the organic-C flush and microbial C were re-examined. The kec-factors varied widely between soils and were strongly influenced by soil water content. It is recommended that soils should be rewetted. when required, to the -5kPa water potential, to ensure that the fumigation stage is fully effective. The reliability of the SIR and fumigation-incubation methods is discussed and a revised calibration for the SIR method: microbial C (/gmg g-1) = 50(/gmlCO2g-1h-1) is proposed, based on14C-labelling and alternative methods of calcula the CO2-C flush when using the fumigation-incubation method. Taking account of possible underestimation of microbial C by these calibrations, a value of 0.35 is suggested as being representative of an overall kec-factor for New Zealand soils. Variability between soils means there is an error in applying an average factor to all soils, but a standard method should be adequate for most applications of microbial C measurements. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

@article{Schimel2003,
abstract = {Traditional models of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition are all based on first order kinetics in which the decomposition rate of a particular C pool is proportional to the size of the pool and a simple decomposition constant (dC/dt = kC). In fact, SOM decomposition is catalyzed by extracellular enzymes that are produced by microorganisms. We built a simple theoretical model to explore the behavior of the decomposition-microbial growth system when the fundamental kinetic assumption is changed from first order kinetics to exoenzymes catalyzed decomposition (dC/dt = KC X Enzymes). An analysis of the enzyme kinetics showed that there must be some mechanism to produce a non-linear response of decomposition rates to enzyme concentration-the most likely is competition for enzyme binding on solid substrates as predicted by Langmuir adsorption isotherm theory. This non-linearity also induces C limitation, regardless of the potential supply of C. The linked C and N version of the model showed that actual polymer breakdown and microbial use of the released monomers can be disconnected, and that it requires relatively little N to maintain the maximal rate of decomposition, regardless of the microbial biomass' ability to use the breakdown products. In this model, adding a pulse of C to an N limited system increases respiration, while adding N actually decreases respiration (as C is redirected from waste respiration to microbial growth). For many years, researchers have argued that the lack of a respiratory response by soil microbes to added N indicates that they are not N limited. This model suggests that conclusion may be wrong. While total C flow may be limited by the functioning of the exoenzyme system, actual microbial growth may be N limited. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The suitability of fumigation-incubation and fumigation-extraction procedures for measuring microbial C and N in strongly acid litter and different depths of soil of a southern beech (Nothofagus spp) forest was investigated. The substrate-induced respiration (SIR) method was also briefly examined. In the fumigation-incubation method, a large inoculum (20{\%} w/w) of unfumigated sample and controls of either fumigated L and FH materials or unfumigated mineral soil incubated for 10–20 days gave maximum CO2-C flush values; controls of unfumigated material incubated for 0–10 days were unsuitable. The kc-factors selected for conversion of CO2-C flush to microbial C depended on sample pH and ranged from 0.28 to 0.44. Use of no control, and a common kc-factor of 0.45, appeared to over-estimate microbial C in L and FH samples, but gave reasonable estimates in the samples of mineral soil. Inoculum size had no detectable influence on mineral-N flush, determined with an unfumigated control. In the fumigation-extraction procedure, increasing fumigation time from 1 to 5 days significantly increased all extractable-N, but not extractable-C, values. Means of experimentally determined kEC-factors, for converting extractable-C flush to microbial C, varied from 0.28 to 0.31 (SD, 0.05–0.09), depending on which 10–20 day control was used in calibration with the fumigation-incubation method. The kEN-factors when calculated in a similar way appeared unrealistically high. The SIR method appeared to under-estimate microbial biomass, when a conventional formula was used for converting CO2 produced to microbial C. Further calibration of the SIR procedure, however, seems warranted. The fumigation-extraction procedure is generally recommended for measuring microbial C and N in these strongly acid samples, using a kEC-factor of c 0.30 and the provisional kEN-factor of 0.45, respectively.},

The structure of microbial communities may vary over depth and the distribution of their cellular components may result in variations in the value of the calibration coefficient Kec. To verify whether this is so, we adopted a procedure based on in situ labelling of the microbial biomass using 14C-labelled carbon substrates. This procedure was evaluated under different operating conditions, by changing the chemical type (glucose or acetate), and the amount and duration of contact with the tracer substrates. Experimental data support two main conclusions. First, realistic values of the Kec coefficient can be obtained for subsoil microflora as long as they are determined under nutrient conditions similar to those prevailing in the natural environment. Second, a relationship exists between the value of the Kec coefficient and the depth in the soil profile.},

abstract = {Microbial decomposition of Soil Organic Matter (SOM) is largely controlled by environmental and edaphic factors such as temperature, pH, and moisture. However, microbial metabolism is controlled by catabolite repression, which leads microbes to grow on preferred nutrient and energy sources first. In particular, Catabolite Repression for Carbon (CR-C) defines the hierarchical preference of bacteria for particular C sources. This control depends on the presence of signal molecules conferring bacteria a memory for recent growth conditions on less preferred C sources. The combined effect of catabolite repression and microbial memory (called here Memory-Associated Catabolite Repression for Carbon, MACR-C) has not yet been investigated in detail. First, we use observations and a numerical model to test the hypothesis that MACR-C explains substrate preferential consumption in a simple, 2-C substrate system, whereas Michaelis-Menten-Monod kinetics of competitive substrate consumption, non-competitive inhibition, or their combination, do not. Next, we carry out numerical analyses to explore the sensitivity of (1) estimated parameters to experimental observations and (2) model structure to steady-state substrate concentration under pulse or continuous substrate application. Our results show that MACR-C substantially affected substrate consumption and microbial readiness to switch between C sources.},

These soils have received different organic amendments and fertilisers, every other year since 1956, which have resulted in different soil C contents and pH. Chloroform-labile C and dsDNA concentrations ranged from 50 to 208 $\mu$g and from 24 to 95 $\mu$g g−1 of soil, respectively. Soil concentrations of dsDNA and chloroform-labile C were highly correlated (r=0.96). The ratios of ergosterol to chloroform-labile C and ergosterol to dsDNA varied between the soils, indicating differences in the fungal-to-total biomass ratio. Despite differences in microbial community composition, the concentration of dsDNA was generally proportional to the concentration of chloroform-labile C and the two appeared to be equivalent measures of soil microbial biomass.},

abstract = {We combined measurements of dsDNA, using a newly developed assay for quantitative determination of dsDNA in crude soil extracts (Sandaa et al., 1998, Soil Biology {\&} Biochemistry 30, 265–268), with measurements of biomass C according to the fumigation extraction (FE) technique and calculations of growth characteristics obtained from respiration curves to measure microbial growth in soil after glucose addition. Our results showed that the exponential increase in respiration rate after glucose addition was accompanied by an exponential increase in the amount of dsDNA extracted from the soil. Values of the specific microbial growth rate ($\mu$) obtained from respiration rates and from dsDNA concentrations were almost identical. This suggests that changes in dsDNA quantitatively reflected microbial growth in soil after glucose addition. However, changes in chloroform labile C (CL-C) did not reflect microbial growth during the exponential phase. The increases in CL-C preceded the formation of dsDNA. This resulted in a 4-fold decrease in the ratio of dsDNA-to-CL-C 5 h after glucose addition compared to the initial value. This ratio then increased and towards the end of the incubation (216 h) had reached that of the non-amended soil. With an increase in the rate of glucose addition the proportion of glucose C respired increased while the proportion of glucose C recovered in the chloroform labile fraction decreased. The lowest rate of glucose application (100 $\mu$g C g−1) resulted in microbial uptake of glucose C, without there having been an increase in the amount of dsDNA nor evidence of growth from the respiration data. Such uptake without growth confirms earlier suggestions that at low rates of glucose addition the C assimilated is stored or incorporated in the microbial cytoplasm. We conclude that measurements of dsDNA and respiration rates can be used to measure specific microbial growth rates after substrate addition to soil, and that dsDNA is an alternative to quantifying microbial biomass under conditions where the FE technique is not wholly reliable.},

@article{Oldfield2018,
abstract = {The size of the soil carbon sink depends on the balance between soil organic matter (SOM) formation and decomposition. Our understanding of how SOM forms and is stabilized, however, is shifting. Traditional theory maintains the formation of SOM is due to chemical complexity: difficult to decompose plant inputs persist in the soil while easily decomposable inputs are respired as CO2. However, consensus is now building around an alternative thesis, hypothesizing that the plant inputs most easily assimilated by soil decomposers are the ones stabilized as SOM because dead microbial biomass is now considered one of the primary components of stable SOM. As such, the efficiency with which the microbial community uses these plant inputs has direct implications for the amount and rate of SOM formation under both a constant and changing climate. Our study empirically tests and measures the effects of substrate quality, quantity, and temperature on SOM formation rates – a process that may have profound impact on carbon stocks. We used 13C-labeled substrates representative of plant root exudates (simple sugars, amino acids, and organic acids) to determine the proportion of substrate retained within SOM, microbial biomass, dissolved organic carbon, or evolved as 13CO2. We found that glucose, the substrate most efficiently assimilated by the microbial biomass, leads to the greatest amount of SOM formation compared to glycine and oxalic acid. In contrast to expectations, higher concentrations of substrate addition lead to proportionally less 13C label retention than lower concentrations. Temperature had a negligible impact on SOM formation, with higher temperatures actually leading to slight increases in SOM formation. While substrate quality and quantity drove the largest differences in SOM formation rates, once metabolized by the microbial biomass, eventual incorporation of carbon into the mineral associated SOM pool (thought to be the most stable of the soil C pools), was effectively equivalent across treatments. Our data suggest that changing composition and amount of labile carbon substrates supplied to soils will likely be key determinants of SOM formation rates and, hence, potentially soil carbon stock sizes.},

However, we lack empirical evidence to demonstrate the role of microbial community in driving soil respiration - a key ecosystem process for global sustainability and climate regulation. Here, we used a long-term field experiment including multiple management practices, to identify, via statistical modeling, the role of microbial community composition in influencing soil respiration. We analyzed major soil properties and microbial (both bacterial and fungal) abundance, diversity and community composition. We found that different management regimes led to different soil respiration rates. Most importantly, microbial community composition explained a unique portion of the variation in soil respiration, which cannot be accounted for by key respiration drivers such as soil properties and other microbial attributes (richness and total abundance). Microbial biomass and fungal richness were also identified as key drivers of soil respiration. Our results indicate that inclusions of microbial compositional data in Earth system models can be potentially used to improve our capacity to predict changes in soil C balance under changing environments.},

@article{Hanegraaf2000,
abstract = {A mechanistic model is presented that describes the respiro-fermentative physiology of yeast. The model assumes the presence of multiple types of glucose carriers and multiple assimilation pathways. Respiro-fermentative physiology is explained by the mechanistic response of the different types of carriers and assimilation pathways on the substrate concentration. At low substrate concentrations, glucose is taken up mainly via a high affinity carrier with a low maximum uptake rate. At high substrate concentrations, this carrier becomes saturated and the main pathway for glucose uptake is via a low affinity carrier with a high maximum uptake rate. The price to pay for the high uptake rate is a lowered assimilation efficiency, resulting in a low biomass yield. Product formation occurs via the pathway with the high uptake rate. The model explains the link between substrate concentration and product formation generally observed in the literature on yeast and bacteria. Model parameter values are estimated by fitting data from the literature. The model distinguishes itself from other models in that it does not rely on the presence of switches, such as the 'critical dilution rate', or on the assumption that the respiratory capacity reaches its maximum during respiro-fermentative metabolism. The present theory is not designed exclusively for the phenomenon of respiro-fermentative physiology: it describes the degradation of substances by heterotrophic micro-organisms in general.},
