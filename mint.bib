abstract = {The biomass composition of microorganisms depends on the growth conditions. This study explores whether a two-component model can explain how the elemental and macromolecular composition of the biomass of bacteria varies with the specific growth rate. The model describes the rates at which microorganisms assimilate substrates into reserves and utilize reserves for maintenance and growth. Crucial model assumptions are that biomass consists of reserves and structure and that each of these components has an invariant composition. The composition of biomass can vary when the ratio between reserves and structure varies. Literature data on the macromolecular composition of Escherichia coli, cultivated on various substrates, show that the protein, RNA and DNA content of biomass follow a distinctive trend when plotted as a function of the dry-weight-specific growth rate. This observation leads to the proposition that the macromolecular composition of E. coli depends directly on the growth rate, and only indirectly on the carbon- and energy-source used as substrate. We show that the variation of the macromolecular composition of E. coli over its entire range of growth rates can be described with invariant macromolecular compositions of the reserve and structural components of biomass. The model is also applied to our data on a succinate-limited continuous culture of Paracoccus denitrificans. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Genome scale metabolic reconstructions are developed to efficiently engineer biocatalysts and bioprocesses based on a rational approach. However, in most reconstructions, due to the lack of appropriate measurements, experimentally determined growth parameters are simply taken from literature including other organisms, which reduces the usefulness and suitability of these models. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is an outstanding biocatalyst given its versatile metabolism, its ability to generate sufficient energy and turnover of NADH and NAD. To apply this strain optimally in industrial production, a previously developed genome-scale metabolic model (iJP815) was experimentally assessed and streamlined to enable accurate predictions of the outcome of metabolic engineering approaches. To substantially improve the accuracy of the genome scale model (iJP815), continuous bioreactor cultures on a mineral medium with glucose as a sole carbon source were carried out at different dilution rates, which covered pulling analysis of the macromolecular composition of the biomass. Besides, the maximum biomass yield (on substrate) of 0.397 gDCW {\textperiodcentered} gglc-1, the maintenance coefficient of 0.037 gglc {\textperiodcentered} gDCW-1 {\textperiodcentered} h-1 and the maximum specific growth rate of 0.59 h-1 were determined. Only the DNA fraction increased with the specific growth rate. This resulted in reliable estimation for the Growth-Associated Maintenance (GAM) of 85 mmolATP {\textperiodcentered} gDCW-1 and the Non Growth-Associated Maintenance (NGAM) of 3.96 mmolATP {\textperiodcentered} gDCW-1 {\textperiodcentered} h-1. Both values were found significantly different from previous assignment as a consequence of a lower yield and higher maintenance coefficient than originally assumed. Contrasting already published 13C flux measurements and the improved model allowed for constraining the solution space, by eliminating futile cycles. Furthermore, the model predictions were compared with transcriptomic data at overall good consistency, which helped to identify missing links. By careful interpretation of growth stoichiometry and kinetics when grown in the presence of glucose, this work reports on an accurate genome scale metabolic model of Pseudomonas putida, providing a solid basis for its use in designing superior strains for biocatalysis. By consideration of substrate specific variation in stoichiometry and kinetics, it can be extended to other substrates and new mutants.},

Soil concentrations of dsDNA and chloroform-labile C were highly correlated (r=0.96). The ratios of ergosterol to chloroform-labile C and ergosterol to dsDNA varied between the soils, indicating differences in the fungal-to-total biomass ratio. Despite differences in microbial community composition, the concentration of dsDNA was generally proportional to the concentration of chloroform-labile C and the two appeared to be equivalent measures of soil microbial biomass.},

abstract = {Indigenous soil bacteria were released from a clay loam soil by repeated washing and centrifugation followed by density gradient centrifugation to remove enough soil particles to allow a flow cytometric (FC) study of cell numbers, cell sizes, and DNA content in single cells. The bacteria were suspended in liquid soil extract medium and incubated at 15°C for 60 h, during which direct fluorescence microscopic counts (acridine orange direct counts, AODC) were done along with the FC measurements. Cells of Escherichia coli with a known number of whole genomes per cell (rifampicin treated) were used as a calibration standard both for the DNA measurements (mitramycin-ethidium bromide stain) and cell volumes (light scatter). In response to the nutrients in the soil extract medium, the indigenous soil bacteria increased in numbers and respiration rate after a lag period of about 17 h. The onset of growth was seen first as an increase in respiration rate, numbers of large cells, and the amounts of DNA per cell in the large cells. Respiration and direct microscopical determination of biovolume was used to calculate the average growth yield on the basis of cell carbon, which was found to be 20-30{\%} during the period of active growth. For separate volume groups of the indigenous cells, the DNA content ranged from 1.5 to 15 fg DNA per cell, the majority being below 4 fg DNA. During growth in soil extract medium, the numbers of large cells (volume {\textgreater} 0.18 $\mu$m3) increased, and the frequency of cells with high DNA contents increased as well for this group. For the smallest sized cells (volumes {\textless} 0.065 $\mu$m3) it was not possible to detect any increase in numbers during the 60-h incubation, and the DNA contents of these cells remained virtually unchanged. Compared with cell volumes based on microscopy (AODC), the FC-light scatter data grossly overestimated the volume for indigenous cells but apparently not for the newly formed cells during growth in the suspension. This probably reflects differences in light scatter properties due to adsorbed materials on the indigenous cells. The FC-DNA measurements confirmed earlier findings in that the average DNA content per cell was low (around 2 fg DNA per cell), but demonstrated a positive relationship between cell size and DNA content for indigenous cells. {\textcopyright} 1995 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {Continuous cultures of the penicillin producing fungus Penicillium chrysogenum have been analyzed with respect to the macromolecular composition of the mycelium, All cultivations were carried out using a chemically defined medium with glucose as the growth limiting component, Biomass was harvested at steady state and analyzed for proteins, lipids, RNA, DNA, and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates present in the cell wall, i.e., glucans and chitin, and carbohydrates serving as storage materials, i.e., glycogen, were measured, It was observed that the levels of DNA and lipids are relative constant, whereas the proteins and stable RNA levels increase with the specific growth rate and the total amount of carbohydrates decreases with the specific growth rate. Glycogen is only present in small amounts, decreasing with the specific growth rate. As an average the measured macromolecules account for 77 +/- 2{\%} (w/w) of the biomass, On the basis of estimations of the metabolic costs for biosynthesis and polymerization of the different macromolecules the total ATP and NADPH requirements for cell biosynthesis from glucose and inorganic salts, i.e., Y-xATP,Y-growth, and Y-xNADPH, have been quantified, The biosynthesis of 1 g biomass was calculated to require 39.9 mmol of ATP and 7.5 mmol of NADPH when cytosolic acetyl-CoA is formed from citrate by citrate lyase and oxaloacetate is recycled back into the TCA cycle. Other pathways of acetyl-CoA biosynthesis have been considered, The calculations show that the different biosynthetic routes for generating cytosolic. acetyl-CoA have a significant influence on the theoretical value of ATP and NADPH requirements for cell biosynthesis, Combining a detailed stoichiometric model for growth and product formation of P. chrysogenum with experimental data on the macromolecular composition of P. chrysogenum and precise measurements of substrate uptake and product formation the intracellular flux distribution was calculated for different cultivation conditions.},

abstract = {Whereas it is acknowledged that the C:N:P stoichiometry of consumers and their resources affects both the structure and the function of food webs, and eventually influences broad-scale processes such as global carbon cycles, the mechanistic basis for the variation in stoichiometry has not yet been fully explored. Empirical evidence shows that the specific growth rate is positively related to RNA concentration both between and within taxa in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Since RNA is rich in P and constitutes a substantial part of the, total P in organisms, a high growth rate is also connected with a high P content. We argue that the reason for this pattern is that the growth of all biota is closely linked with their protein synthesis rate, and thus with the concentration of ribosomal RNA. Dynamic energy budget theory supports the positive relationship between RNA and specific growth rate in microorganisms, whereas the predictions concerning multicellulars only partially agrees with the observed pattern. In a simple model of consumer growth, we explore the consequences of various allocation patterns of RNA; protein, carbohydrates/lipids, and other biochemical constituents on organism potential growth rate and C:N:P stoichiometry. According to the model the percentage of N, and especially percentage of P per dry mass increases with increasing specific growth rate. Furthermore, the model suggests that macromolecule allocation patterns and thus N:P stoichiometry are allowed to differ substantially at low growth rates whereas the stoichiometry at high growth rates is much more constricted at low N:R The model fits empirical data reasonably well, but it is also acknowledged that complex life cycles and associated physiological constraints may result in other patterns. We also use a similar approach of modeling organism growth from basic biochemical principles to illustrate fundamental connections among biochemical allocation and C:N stoichiometry in autotroph production, which is based on allocation patterns between carbohydrates and rubisco. Similar to the RNA-protein model, macromolecular composition and C:N ratios are more constrained at high than at low growth rates. The models and the empirical data together suggest that organism growth is tightly linked with the organisms' biochemical and elemental composition. The stoichiometry of growth impinges on nutrient cycles and carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level. Thus, focus on the biological basis of organism C:N:P stoichiometry can mechanistically connect growth strategy and biochemical and cellular mechanisms of biota to major ecological consequences.},

abstract = {Flow-cytometry was used to measure cell volumes and DNA contents of single cells in cultures of soil bacteria during exponential growth and starvation conditions. DNA was measured after staining with mitramycin/ethidium bromide. The measurement of DNA was calibrated with rifampicin-treated cells of E. coli containing even numbers of genomes per cell. Cell volumes were assessed by scatter light measurements. Constant DNA to biovolume relations over a range of cell sizes were found for each of the bacteria at exponential growth, and DNA contents per cell varied over a range equivalent to 1-4 genomes per cell. At generation times of 1.0-1.5 h, two genomes were registered as a mean. After starvation of washed cells in a salt solution (24 hrs), a fraction of the cells in each culture had DNA contents equivalent to 1 genome, but significant fractions retained DNA contents equivalent to 2-4 genomes. Attempts to create cells with even numbers of genomes per cell by treatment with rifampicin was successful on an Acinetobacter sp. In contrast, the response to rifampicin was less clear for Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. chlororaphis, and unclear for the gram positive bacteria isolated from soil. The mean decrease in biovolume upon starvation was 4.1 times (range 1.3-8.1 times) and larger than the mean decrease in DNA content of 1.8 (range 1.3-2.7 times). Cell volume determinations by measurements of scatter light was compared with volume determinations by fluorescence microscopy. The amounts of scatter light per volumes was variable, not only did we find large differences between bacterial types, but also between starving and exponentially growing cells of the same isolate. In order to use light scatter as a measure of biovolume, internal standards has to be chosen of comparable size and surface properties as to soil bacteria. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

Chloroform-labile carbon (CLC) and nitrogen (CLN) determined by chloroform fumigation methods have been the major parameters of soil microbial biomass, but to date, there have been few studies of the relationship between DNA and CLN among soils with different characteristics. We applied DNA assays to the estimation of soil microbial biomass in various types of soil in Japan. The quantitative relationships among DNA, CLC and CLN released by the chloroform fumigation–extraction method were examined in 35 soil samples including five different soil types. The amount of DNA was moderately correlated with CLC (r=0.652, n=35), but there was no significant correlation in one of the soil types (fluvisol) representing a typical soil in Japan (r=0.124; n=15). Moreover, there was a strong correlation between DNA and CLN (r=0.887; n=35), and the correlation was high in every major soil type. These findings raise the possibility that DNA could be used to estimate biomass N even among different kinds of soil, with a conversion factor of 2.75 for DNA ($\mu$gg−1 soil).},

abstract = {Neisseria meningitidis is a human pathogen that can infect diverse sites within the human host. The major diseases caused by N. meningitidis are responsible for death and disability, especially in young infants. At the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI) a vaccine against serogroup B organisms is currently being developed. This study describes the influence of the growth rate of N. meningitidis on its macro-molecular composition and its metabolic activity and was determined in chemostat cultures. In the applied range of growth rates, no significant changes in RNA content and protein content with growth rate were observed in N. meningitidis. The DNA content in N. meningitidis was somewhat higher at the highest applied growth rate. The phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide content in N. meningitidis changed with growth rate but no specific trends were observed. The cellular fatty acid composition and the amino acid composition did not change significantly with growth rate. Additionally, it was found that the PorA content in outer membrane vesicles was significantly lower at the highest growth rate. The metabolic fluxes at various growth rates were calculated using flux balance analysis. Errors in fluxes were calculated using Monte Carlo Simulation and the reliability of the calculated flux distribution could be indicated, which has not been reported for this type of analysis. The yield of biomass on substrate (Y(x/s)) and the maintenance coefficient (m(s)) were determined as 0.44 (+/-0.04) g g(-1) and 0.04 (+/-0.02) g g(-1) h(-1), respectively. The growth associated energy requirement (Y(x/ATP)) and the non-growth associated ATP requirement for maintenance (m(ATP)) were estimated as 0.13 (+/-0.04) mol mol(-1) and 0.43 (+/-0.14) mol mol(-1) h(-1), respectively. It was found that the split ratio between the Entner-Doudoroff and the pentose phosphate pathway, the sole glucose utilizing pathways in N. meningitidis, had a minor effect on ATP formation rate but a major effect on the fluxes going through for instance the citric-acid cycle. For this reason, we presented flux ranges for underdetermined parts of metabolic network rather than presenting single flux values, which is more commonly done in literature.},

abstract = {Computational representations of metabolism are increasingly common in medical, environmental, and bioprocess applications. Cellular growth is often an important output of computational biology analyses, and therefore, accurate measurement of biomass constituents is critical for relevant model predictions. There is a distinct lack of detailed macromolecular measurement protocols, including comparisons to alternative assays and methodologies, as well as tools to convert the experimental data into biochemical reactions for computational biology applications. Herein is compiled a concise literature review regarding methods for five major cellular macromolecules (carbohydrate, DNA, lipid, protein, and RNA) with a step-by-step protocol for a select method provided for each macromolecule. Additionally, each method was tested on three different bacterial species, and recommendations for troubleshooting and testing new species are given. The macromolecular composition measurements were used to construct biomass synthesis reactions with appropriate quality control metrics such as elemental balancing for common computational biology methods, including flux balance analysis and elementary flux mode analysis. Finally, it was demonstrated that biomass composition can substantially affect fundamental model predictions. The effects of biomass composition on in silico predictions were quantified here for biomass yield on electron donor, biomass yield on electron acceptor, biomass yield on nitrogen, and biomass degree of reduction, as well as the calculation of growth associated maintenance energy; these parameters varied up to 7{\%}, 70{\%}, 35{\%}, 12{\%}, and 40{\%}, respectively, between the reference biomass composition and ten test biomass compositions. The current work furthers the computational biology community by reviewing literature regarding a variety of common analytical measurements, developing detailed procedures, testing the methods in the laboratory, and applying the results to metabolic models, all in one publicly available resource.},

This attenuation response could result from changes in microbial physiological properties with increasing temperature, such as a decline in the fraction of assimilated carbon that is allocated to growth, termed carbon-use efficiency(6). Here we explore these mechanisms using a microbial-enzyme model to simulate the responses of soil carbon to warming by 5 degrees C. We find that declines in microbial biomass and degradative enzymes can explain the observed attenuation of soil-carbon emissions in response to warming. Specifically, reduced carbon-use efficiency limits the biomass of microbial decomposers and mitigates the loss of soil carbon. However, microbial adaptation or a change in microbial communities could lead to an upward adjustment of the efficiency of carbon use, counteracting the decline in microbial biomass and accelerating soil-carbon loss. We conclude that the soil-carbon response to climate warming depends on the efficiency of soil microbes in using carbon.},

abstract = {A growing body of literature documents the pressing need to develop soil biogeochemistry models that more accurately reflect contemporary understanding of soil processes and better capture soil carbon (C) responses to environmental perturbations. Models that explicitly represent microbial activity offer inroads to improve representations of soil biogeochemical processes, but have yet to consider relationships between litter quality, functional differences in microbial physiology, and the physical protection of microbial byproducts in forming stable soil organic matter (SOM). To address these limitations, we introduce the MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS) model, and evaluate it by comparing site-level soil C projections with observations from a long-term litter decomposition study and soil warming experiment. In MIMICS, the turnover of litter and SOM pools is governed by temperature-sensitive Michaelis–Menten kinetics and the activity of two physiologically distinct microbial functional types. The production of microbial residues through microbial turnover provides inputs to SOM pools that are considered physically or chemically protected. Soil clay content determines the physical protection of SOM in different soil environments. MIMICS adequately simulates the mean rate of leaf litter decomposition observed at temperate and boreal forest sites, and captures observed effects of litter quality on decomposition rates. Moreover, MIMICS better captures the response of SOM pools to experimental warming, with rapid SOM losses but declining temperature sensitivity to long-term warming, compared with a more conventional model structure. MIMICS incorporates current microbial theory to explore the mechanisms by which litter C is converted to stable SOM, and to improve predictions of soil C responses to environmental change.},
